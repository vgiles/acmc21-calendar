_Mutatis Mutandis: Using Computational Thinking to Interpret Scores by Herbert Brvºn_

This discussion examines the work Mutatis Mutandis (1968/1995) by early computer music pioneer, Herbert Brün (1918-2000). Brün started his work with computer music in the late 1950s in Paris, then the WDR studio in Cologne and the Siemens studio in Munich. In 1962 he was invited by Lejaren Hiller to join the faculty at the University of Illinois where he remained for the rest of his working life.
Next to music, Brün was also a computer graphic artist, a cybernetician, and actively interested in the political and social aspects of music and composition. It is these elements that influence his work Mutatis Mutandis. In this piece, Brün presents a number of computer generated graphics, but instead of treating these graphics like a score, performer is given instructions to “construct, by thought and imagination, the interpreter’s version of a structure that might leave the traces which the graphic displays.” In this sense, he sought a means of stimulating the idea of structured process for the “composing interpreter” rather than simply an activity in attempted reconstruction. This meta approach can challenge how we view the capability of computers to generate music and what graphic scores can communicate to the performer.
The author will document and reflect upon the process of preparation of this work for performance. In seeking to develop a version which best combines his creative talents within the bounds of the score, the author will try to develop a deeper understanding and what it means to creatively apply principles of “algorithmic thought” and “cybernetics” to an acoustic performance. He will also present a recording of a performance of this piece that will demonstrate how computers can indirectly be used to inspire creativity.
