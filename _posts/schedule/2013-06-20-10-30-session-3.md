_Enter The Packetsphere: The Browser-as-medium in the internet-of-overconsuming-things era_

This paper addresses approaches to the web browser as an artistic medium, and how that artistic medium is inherently connected to the earth and the people who inhabit it. It focuses on a recent web art piece titled Packetsphere developed by two of the paper’s authors (Argabrite and Brown). The idea of the browser-as-medium is introduced by providing an overview of historical and contemporary examples of art on the web. The internet’s usage in art will then be further contextualized through an investigation into its real-world implications, with an emphasis placed on the wide-reaching environmental impacts and ethics of internet usage (especially for art). These two paths of inquiry will aid and be aided by an in-depth analysis of Packetsphere, a research-based creative output that focuses on salvaging historical expressions of the web while educating about its potential dangers. This is creatively delivered as an abstract travelogue-style journey through the physical infrastructure of the internet. Information about current realities and consequences of the internet with salvaged media and sounds of the historical web. Through this investigation a better understanding of the very real consequences of our virtual spaces will be met via a creative practice lens.
