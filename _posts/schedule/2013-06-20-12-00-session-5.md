_Synth Building in CSound With the Cabbage Framework_

Csound is a sound and music computing system that is a direct descendant of the MusicN family of computer music languages. It is an incredibly powerful and flexible coding environment. Cabbage is a framework that provides flexible graphic user interface widgets that can be used to control Csound code in real time. This workshop will provide an overview of the basic syntax of the Csound within Cabbage. Participants will learn how to create and modify a basic software synthesizer from a simple template. No previous experience with Csound or Cabbage is required, but participants are encouraged to download and install Cabbage on their own computer so they can actively participate in this session.
