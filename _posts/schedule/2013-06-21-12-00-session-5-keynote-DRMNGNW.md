**Song Still Sovereign Now**  delivered by Neil Morris aka DRMNGNOW  will explore the importance of First Nations song and its place in still holding Sovereign value in so called Australia . This will be explored through a talk which will cover some of the work of DRMNGNOW including songs such as 'Australia Does Not Exist' , 'Indigenous Land' and 'Get back to the Land' where Morris will explain how he uses mediums of electronic music as a Sovereign tool as a means of honouring Indigenous Song continuation on the continent of so called Australia.
