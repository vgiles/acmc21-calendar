_Approaches to generative composition with modular synthesisers_

A range of compositional processes unique to modular synthesisers including generative systems based upon analog circuits are a key factor driving the resurgence of interest in modular synthesisers (White, 2019). Using the freely available VCV software, which simulates a modular synthesiser environment, this hands-on workshop will support participants to try out a range of processes usually unique to a hardware-based modular synthesiser. The workshop will focus upon rhythmic systems using clock dividers, and boolean logic, then extend to stochastic and complex control voltage systems to generate musical structures. 

I have organised and run a range of workshops over the past 15 years including at Elctrofringe, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Serial Space, LiquidArchitecture, UTS and MESS.
