What is an instrument? What is composition? Through the development of new technologies for sound and art-making, boundaries start to overlap and become blurred...when does our creative process become performance? When do our tools and systems start to resist our input, and instead become guides? What is OUR role in all of this?

In this talk, I'll share my experiences shifting from "classically trained orchestral trumpeter" to "experimental electroacoustic performer-composer" over the last decade, and we will look at how the tools, instruments, and environments we create can spark meaningful questions (and answers) around our ever-evolving artistic identity and practice.
