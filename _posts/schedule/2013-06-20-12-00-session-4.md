_n/a_

JWPATON is a Yuin artist and musician currently living on Darug Country, Blue Mountains. Working with lofi field recordings, JWPATON creates layered, processed manipulations of original source material. By pushing the limitations of digital software and a minimal modular synth setup, he creates long form ambient soundtracks. 

**12:30pm: Sze Tsang**
_The Lost_

The Lost is an audio-visual contemplation of the sensation of loss, and the subsequent feelings of dislocation. The work is based on a map of Perth from 1838, detailing many of Perth's now-lost wetlands, as well as a field recording from Herdman's Lake and sonified longitudinal and latitude values. The Lost is an exploration of connections between artist, history and place, and how these aspects can inform and intersect in a piece of work.
